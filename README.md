**IU University of Applied Sciences**

**Study program:** Computer Science

**Topic:** State management in Flutter applications: a comparative study

**Student:** Sergei Ulvis (enrolment number: 32113004)

## Overall Aim

Flutter supports a variety of state management solutions, each with distinct paradigms and trade-offs. Managing application state efficiently is crucial for building scalable and maintainable apps, especially as they grow in complexity. Developers often face challenges in selecting the most suitable state management library for their projects, as the options vary in terms of complexity, performance, and scalability.

**Aim:** Conduct a comparative study of popular state management solutions in Flutter (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, Redux, GetX, Mobx), and evaluate their performance, ease of use, and maintainability to provide actionable recommendations for developers.

## Objectives

1. **Identify and describe** the most widely used state management libraries in Flutter, including their architecture, features, and use cases.

2. **Develop prototype application** implementing the same functionality using different state management solutions.

3. **Compare the prototypes** (using different state management) using identified key metrics (ISO 25010 standard).

4. **Propose best practices and recommendations** for selecting state management solutions using comparison results in context of application's scope & complexity.
